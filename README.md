PID servo controller
==========================

This project consists on a my attempt to implement PID to control servo drive. It assumes that servo is usual dc motor with some kind of position feedback - optical encoder on motor shaft as an example. It based on the best, in my humble opinion, implementation from [Elm Chan](http://elm-chan.org/works/smc/report_e.html).
